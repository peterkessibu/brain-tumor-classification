## 🎯 Project Overview
A cutting-edge Streamlit application that uses AI to analyze brain MRI scans! Our system can detect and classify four types of conditions:
- 🔴 Glioma
- 🔵 Meningioma
- 🟢 Pituitary Tumor
- ⚪ No Tumor

## 🤖 Our Smart Models

### 1. 🌟 Transfer Learning with Xception (The Powerhouse)

<details>
<summary>📐 Architecture Details</summary>

```python
Base: Xception (pretrained on ImageNet) 🏗️
Input Shape: (299, 299, 3)
Magic Ingredients:
- Flatten Layer (for 2D → 1D conversion)
- Dropout (0.3) 🎲
- Dense (128, ReLU) ⚡
- Dropout (0.25) 🎲
- Dense (4, Softmax) 🎯
```
</details>

#### 💫 Why Xception is Awesome?
- 🚀 Uses depth-wise separable convolutions (super efficient!)
- 🎓 Pre-trained on millions of images (it's already smart!)
- 📊 Perfect for capturing complex medical image patterns

#### 🛠️ Our Special Sauce
- 🔄 Global Max Pooling: Keeps the important stuff
- 🎲 Strategic Dropout: Prevents memorization
- 🧮 Smart Dense Layer: Compresses information beautifully
- ⚡ Adamax Optimizer: Stable and reliable for medical images

### 2. 🔧 Custom CNN Model (The Specialist)

- 📏 Works with (224, 224, 3) images
- 🎯 Specifically trained for brain scans
- 🧠 Understands brain MRI characteristics
